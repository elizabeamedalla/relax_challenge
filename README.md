Relax Inc. is a fictional highly funded startup based in San Francisco that makes productivity and project management software that's extremely popular with both individuals and teams. My task is to define an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on three separate days in at least one sevenÂ­-day period, and identify which factors predict future user adoption.
